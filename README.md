# Ai-Video-Builder

Make videos with ai images from youtube videos.

Uses stable diffusion for image generation and openAi whisper for audio transcription.

Here is a video it has made using captions from a youtube video.

I have made a dockerized version of this that will run on a kubernetes cluster as a CronJob that will automatically upload videos from a queue to my youtube channel everyday.

Here's repo that has the website I made to add new videos to the queue: https://github.com/jediknight813/Ai-Video-Building-Website
